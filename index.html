						<h2>About Me</h2>
					</header>
					<p>My name is Kamaldeep Singh, and I am a dedicated tech enthusiast currently enrolled in a Computer Science program in Germany. I come from an academic background that emphasizes problem-solving and logical thinking. Over time, I've developed a solid foundation in front-end and back-end web development, allowing me to build projects that are both user-friendly and efficient. I am always eager to take on new challenges that help me grow as a developer. Whether it's building websites, learning new languages, or contributing to a team, I thrive in environments that push me forward. I'm also interested in tech for social good.</p>

								<h3>Web Development</h3>
								<p>I am skilled in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also use Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS to create responsive and modern designs. I love turning creative designs into functional websites that look good on all devices. I have experience making personal portfolios, landing pages, and UI prototypes. My goal is to always keep the user experience clean and accessible. I am actively learning more advanced JavaScript frameworks and libraries to elevate my front-end capabilities even further.</p>

								<h3>Backend</h3>
								<p>On the server side, I have hands-on experience with PHP and MySQL for creating and managing dynamic content. I have built form-handling scripts, basic CRUD apps, and user login systems. I'm also exploring Node.js to enhance my JavaScript knowledge and build more scalable server-side logic. Although I'm at the beginner stage with Node, I’m confident in setting up simple APIs and using Express for routing. I understand the importance of security and data validation, and I'm continually learning how to improve performance and handle data responsibly.</p>

								<h3>Learning</h3>
								<p>Currently, I'm learning React to build interactive single-page applications and gain a deeper understanding of component-based design. I am also studying Python, which I find very readable and powerful for automation and data tasks. In addition, I am familiarizing myself with Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. I also take interest in UI/UX principles to improve the design aspect of my projects. I believe a developer should never stop learning, and I make it a priority to keep up with the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>

							<span class="icon solid fa-language"></span>
							<div class="content">
								<h3>Languages</h3>
								<p>I am fluent in English, which is my primary medium for education and communication. I also have a basic understanding of German, which I continue to improve while living and studying in Berlin. Additionally, I speak Punjabi and Hindi, which helps me stay connected to my cultural roots. Being multilingual helps me adapt to diverse environments and collaborate with people from different backgrounds. I believe good communication is as important as technical skill in the professional world.</p>
